# comp6411-clojure

It’s time to try a little functional programming. In this assignment, you will have a
chance to gain experience with the Clojure programming language. The program itself should be
relatively small. However, you will have to think a little about the algorithm in order to actually
produce a working solution. In the process, you should get some sense of the syntax and style of a
functional language.


In terms of your task, it can be described as follows. You can assume that you are an intrepid
explorer, searching for buried treasure. Specifically, you are underground, wandering through a
series of very dark tunnels. You have no light and no signs to guide your way. All you can do is
blindly feel around and wander through the tunnels until you hopefully enter the room that
contains the treasure. You can, however, leave a trail of breadcrumbs behind you so that if you
come to the end of a tunnel and you can’t go any further, you can get back to where you were and
try again in another direction.


This may all sound very abstract, but a simple example will illustrate what has to be done. A map of
the tunnels will be stored in a simple text file. The map is used by the application to determine if the
explorer can move in a certain direction.
